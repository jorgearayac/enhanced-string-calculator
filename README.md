# Enhanced String Calculator

This repository contains my implementation of the **Enhanced String Calculator Challenge**.

The goal of this Task is to develop a feature-rich String Calculator by completing a series of incremental tasks.

## Objectives

- Practice **incremental development** and **clean code** principles.
- Demonstrate ability to **reflect**, **adapt** and **commit** progressively.
- Build the calculator in **Python** and later in **F#**.
